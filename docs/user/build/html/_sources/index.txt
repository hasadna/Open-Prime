Welcome to Open-Prime Users' documentation!
===================================================

.. note:: nothing really works yet

Open Prime helps you host your project's live and development servers.
It includes Postgres, Mongo and Redis servers for your backend,
wraps your app server with Varnish and Nginx and servs your files from a CDN.

After a simple setup, your servers will be automaticly updated
whenever you update your git repository. The system assumes you are using
Travis for CI and if you are not, please stop reading
this guide and add Travis_ to your project.

Quick Start
-----------

First you'll need to get install the `opri` CLI::

    $ curl -Lo- https://[...] | bash

Now create a host for your project::

    $ opri host <short_name> <repo_url | local_dir>
    ...

If you use a local_dir opri will look for the git config and use the
`origin` url as the host's blessed repo.

Next, configure your `.travis.yml` file to fire the update process on success
by adding the following lines to the end of your file::

  notifications:
    webhooks:
      urls:
        - http://opri.hasadna.org.il/events
      on_success: always
      on_failure: never
      on_start: false

Commit your changes and you're done.  Whenever you push to your `master`
or `dev` branches and your tests pass, the  host at
`<short_name>.hasadna.org.il` will be updated.
